# MICRO-POLLING WEBSITE

Within two weeks, The goal of this project is to sketch the core interface design and elements
for a micro-polling website that allows users to post single-question polls for others
to answer. In the subsequent activities, we developed the pages using HTML5 and
CSS, implement form validation in JavaScript, design
and implement the database.

1. Main Page

The purpose of this page is to provide branding for your micro-polling
site, and to show a list of the five most recent active polls. There should
also be a form to allow the user to enter their username and password to
login, and a link to the sign-up page.

2. Sign-up Page

This page should include a form to collect the information required for
creating a new account on your micro-polling site. At the least, it should
collect an email address, screen name, avatar image/graphic, and a
password. The form should ask the user to enter their password twice, to
ensure that it is entered properly.

3. Poll Management Page

This is the default page to load after a successful login. It should show a
list of the polls posted by the logged-in user, ordered by date/time of
creation (most recent first). Eventually, it will be loaded with content
extracted from the database; for now, it can be loaded with sample
information in order to illustrate the design.
Each poll in the list should include the date/time the poll was created, the
question, the list of answers, a graphical representation of the number of
votes for each answer, and the date/time of the most recent vote.
Note that this page will be customized for each logged-in user. As such,
the page should show the screen name and avatar of the logged-in user.
The details of where this information comes from will be handled in
future assignments. 

4. Poll Creation Page

This page contains the form that will be used to allow the logged-in user
to create a new poll. It will have form fields for the open and close
date/times, the question to be asked, and the possible answers (up to
five).

5. Poll Vote Page

This is a public page (no login required) that shows a specific polling
question and allows the user to select one answer from the list provided.
It should also include the screen name and avatar of the user that created
the poll. This page may be accessed from the main page of the site, or
from the logged-in userâ€™s poll management page.
